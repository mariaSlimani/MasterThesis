## Abstract

Nowadays, social platforms appear as essential sources of evidence for companies that need to target potential consumers wishing to buy their products/services. Social networks are experiencing growing interest in various scientific and commercial circles. Indeed, companies are often concerned about their online identity, as they are aware that their reputation can be affected or even destroyed by a comment or a review, which is why they try to better understand the expectations and criticisms that Internet users address them, and they attempt to characterize them according to two axes :

(i) To assess their reputation

(ii) For use in estimating customer satisfaction and improving their experience

However, a new problem arises, the opinions expressed on a given brand, product or service are not necessarily credible. This is due to the new players who have made this risk a business. Indeed, spammers, either individuals or companies, expressly write negative/positive opinions to harm or promote a brand. these reviews are misleading because they are unfounded. The platforms most likely to be affected by these fraudulent attempts are online review sites, as these are considered popular sources of electronic word-of-mouth that help consumers in their decision-making processes. Since fake reviews posted are often inaccurate and uncertain, it can be difficult to distinguish spam reviews from real ones. For this reason, since the formalization of opinion spam detection in 2008, many researchers have been interested in this issue.

This report focuses on the methods present in the literature to address the issues raised above : its objective will be to define the notion of opinion credibility and to identify the works that tackled it in addition to the characterization of reviews and identification of spammers. It will be organized mainly in two parts, the first will concern the analysis of customer sentiments and the second will address the problem of detecting misleading reviews while presenting the current approaches, the major challenges and areas for future research.
